# ConnectedCorps

ConnectedCorps is the fullstack MERN application I created for my capstone project. 


## Introduction

ConnectedCorps is a fullstack MERN application that allows recipients in need of essential items to obtain them while retaining privacy. Recipients can order a combination of items from every category. For example, recipients can order a combination of items in separate categories such as first aid kits, children's toys, and pet supplies. In addition, they can use a map as a reference to help them find nonprofit organizations in their communities.

## Unsolved Problems

One unsolved problem I am trying to fix is the ability for recipients to build custom essential items that may not be available on the list of items available. 

Another unsolved problem was being able to add separate profiles for recipients and nonprofit organizations on the site. 
## Future Enhancements

I may add more features to allow recipients and nonprofit organizations to interact with each other.
